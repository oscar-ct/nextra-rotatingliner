Tribo Dynamics Inc. is developing the rotation liner engine (RLE), a unique lubrication concept for traditional internal combustion engines. The RLE incorporates a rotation liner between the piston and the engine block, exploiting the well proven piston and piston ring advantage of the historic sleeve valve engine (a total of 200 million horsepower of SVE's were built during WW2) and applying it to the modern exhaust-emission-driven reciprocating engine.
