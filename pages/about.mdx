Tribo Dynamics Inc. is developing the rotation liner engine (RLE), a unique lubrication concept for traditional internal combustion engines. The RLE incorporates a rotation liner between the piston and the engine block, exploiting the well proven piston and piston ring advantage of the historic sleeve valve engine ( a total of 200 million horsepower of SVE's were built during WW2) and applying it to the modern exhaust-emission-driven reciprocating engine.

The RLE improves efficiency, decreases pollutants, increases durability, and has applications thought the range of the $50B+ heavy-duty diesel market

The historical evidence demonstrated exceptional durability, reduces friction, and reduction of fuel consumption of prior rotation sleeve engines, called sleeve valve engines

The basic engineering assumption behind the RLE has been confirmed by preliminary results from single cylinder light-duty based RLE prototype.
