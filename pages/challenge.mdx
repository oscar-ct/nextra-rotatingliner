## Commercialization Challenge

#### Engine OEM’s are huge corporations formed many decades ago and are incompatible with revolutionary changes


#### There have been no significant architectural changes of the HD engine over the past 50 years, and due to the high production volume, re-tooling is very expensive

#### To convince the OEM’s to consider these costs, substantial testing and confirmation of the technology is necessary, both in the lab and in the field.  Selling retrofitted engines provides income while generating confirmation of the technology viability

#### Beachhead markets will provide necessary exposure to overcome these obstacles
