## Granted U.S. Patent No. 9,982,538

Describes the rotating liner driving mechanism

Liner rotation eliminates metallic contact of piston rings and piston skirt with the liner minimizing wear, reduces friction, and increases engine life

Mechanical driving mechanism powered by crankshaft pulley with an approximate 3:1 speed ratio

## Granted U.S. Patent No. 10,563,509
