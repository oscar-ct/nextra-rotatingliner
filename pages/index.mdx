# The Rotating Liner Engine
 
Welcome to Rotating Liner! We are improving the efficiency of the most efficient industrial prime mover, the diesel engine, via friction reduction.

## What is a Rotating Liner Engine?

The RLE (Rotating Liner Engine) incorporates a rotating liner between the piston and the engine block, exploiting the well proven piston and piston ring advantage of the historic sleeve valve engine and applying it to the modern exhaust-emission-driven reciprocating engine.

RLE **improves** efficiency, **decreases** pollutants, **increases** durability, and has applications thought the range of the $50B+ heavy-duty diesel market.
