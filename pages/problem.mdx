## Industry Challenges

### The diesel engine is the most efficient industrial prime mover due to its very high cylinder pressures, but high cylinder pressures also generate a substantial amount of engine friction.

### Fuel Efficiency

- Successful reductions in engine friction provides considerable improvements in fuel consumption

- Annual Fuel Cost vs. HD Engine Cost (e.g. Class 8 truck fuel cost ~ $70K/yr, engine initial cost $35K)

### Emissions

- Federal HD fuel consumption and CO2 emissions regulations continue to increase the push for more advanced engine technologies

- Direct link between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions
