## Prototype Highlights

#### Approximately 100 hours engine runtime has proven the face seal at high pressure operation and allows for a complete 6-cylinder beta prototype to be constructed **without technical risk**

#### Approximately 4.0% improvement in peak torque

#### Fuel efficiency (rotating liner vs non-rotating liner cylinder)

#### Additional benefits include:

- Dramatic wear reduction

- Lower lubricant concentration of anti-wear additives

- Longer after-treatment life

- Lower cost lubricants
