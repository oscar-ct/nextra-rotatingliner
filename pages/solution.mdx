## RLE Technology

### We have developed a novel approach to reduce the mechanical losses inside the cylinder of reciprocating IC engines.

Our technology improves upon previously established WWII aircraft “Sleeve Valve” engines

In conventional engines, most of the frictional losses comes from the piston ring and cylinder wall contact, the RLE technology **eliminates** these frictional losses
